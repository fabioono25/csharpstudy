What is the C# History?
=====================
The C# History is a compound of examples that can show how the language was growing during the years. It'll start with the basic concepts of an Oriented-Programming Language, until newer and better features.

## How to use the material
For each version of the language we have a folder containing the examples. It'll have examples and comments so be free to copy and use as reference.

## About C#

C# is an object-oriented language that was born in 2002, with the strategy of Microsoft to provide a more robust and strongly typed language. To achieve this, the idea was following some design goals defined by ECMA.

Design goals from ECMA for C#:
- intended to be simple, modern, general purpose, OOP;
- strongly type checking, array bound checking, check unitialized variables;
- automatic garbage collection;
- distributed environments;
- programmer portability;
- support to internationalization;
- suitable for both hosted and embedded systems.

During these more than 15 years, the language is gaining new improvements. Here are the versions:
