## Preface

Welcome to **"The Evolution of C#"**. This book is a comprehensive guide through the history and development of the C# language, from its inception as a Java competitor to its current status as a multi-paradigm, cross-platform powerhouse.

This book is designed for developers who want to understand not just *what* features were added, but *why*. By understanding the problem each version tried to solve, you gain a deeper appreciation for the language's design and learn to use its features more effectively.

Each chapter covers a major version of C#, highlighting the key features, the problems they solved, and how they changed the way we write code.

## About Me

I am a passionate software engineer with over 15 years of experience in the .NET ecosystem. I've watched C# grow from a proprietary Windows language to the open-source giant it is today.

I wrote this book to consolidate my own knowledge and to provide a clear, structured resource for others. I believe that understanding the history of your tools makes you a better craftsman.
